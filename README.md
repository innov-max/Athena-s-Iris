# Athena's Eye: Computer Vision Project using OpenCV


Athena's Eye is a computer vision project developed using OpenCV, a powerful open-source library for computer vision and image processing. The project aims to provide various computer vision functionalities and techniques to analyze and manipulate images and videos.

## Features
### Object Detection: Athena's Eye leverages OpenCV's object detection algorithms to detect and identify objects in images and videos. It can detect a wide range of objects, including faces, pedestrians, vehicles, and more.

### Image Filtering and Enhancement: Enhance the quality of images using various filtering techniques such as blurring, sharpening, noise reduction, and contrast adjustment. These techniques help to improve image clarity and remove unwanted artifacts.

### Image Segmentation: Athena's Eye offers image segmentation capabilities using OpenCV's algorithms, allowing you to separate objects or regions of interest from the background. This can be useful for tasks like image recognition, scene understanding, and object tracking.

### Facial Recognition: Utilizing OpenCV's face recognition algorithms, Athena's Eye enables facial recognition in images and videos. It can detect and recognize faces, extract facial features, and perform face matching and identification.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extract text from images and perform optical character recognition using OpenCV's OCR capabilities. This feature is helpful for tasks like document scanning, text extraction, and automated data entry.

### Real-time Video Processing: Athena's Eye provides real-time video processing capabilities, allowing you to apply various computer vision techniques to live video streams. This is useful for applications such as surveillance, video analytics, and augmented reality.
